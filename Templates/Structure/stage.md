# Process Stage

Process stages are collections of process elements that are to be executed collectively as part of the same execution cycle while being generally structured in a manner where they deliver some enterprise objective in the form of functional or non-functional goals.

A stage represents a (sub-)process within a broader business process that attains a defined business objective.

The output of the process stage is available to any and all subsequent downstream stage(s) for usage and consumption, until the upstream process stage is re-executed, at which time the new output is then made available.
