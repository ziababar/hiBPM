# Process Phase

Process Phases are sections within a process stage which produce the same result irrespective of the arrangement of process elements within in i.e. the temporal reordering of process elements does not result in any change in the outcome of the process phase.

Given a collection of process elements within a process stage, process elements which need to be in a defined execution sequence should be encapsulated as part of a process phase. The phases of a process should not be predetermined/ preconceived until the process elements are identified, including their temporal constraints.

A process stage may contain one or more process phases with the output of a phase can only be used by the subsequent phases of the same instance.
