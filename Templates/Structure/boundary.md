# Process Boundary

Process Boundaries are means of identifying and demarcating similar process segments with respect to certain process-related attributes such as the frequency of execution, the type of process output, and the behavior of the process segment.

Process boundaries help determine the different levels that may exist within process architectures, and their relative positioning to each other. Thus a process stage may exist at “higher” level (in terms of process stage objective, or execution frequency) than another process stage.
