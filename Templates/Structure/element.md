# Process Element

Process Elements are basic process activity units which produce some output or outcome based on a set of control and data inputs; they may also include the act of making decisions as part of the activity processing.

Process elements indicate the behavior or actions performed by a domain actor or participant that results in an accomplishment of function, or the generation of a measurable output. A label would be associated that specified the nature of the behavior that is performed.

Process elements also encompass the act of decision making. As part of process execution, a decision may need to be made; these decision points are also represented as process elements in process architecture model.
