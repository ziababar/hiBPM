# Trigger Relationship

Trigger relationships are a special kind of data flow that exist between a structural element (process element, process phase or process stage) and another process stage.

Trigger relationships are used to indicate that the completion of an upstream process stage (or a process element) results in the immediate execution of an immediately downstream process stage. Thus, this represents some form of temporal relationship between these two associated process stages.

Triggers can be manual or automatic. Manual triggers are those that are human-initiated and can be “fired” even if triggering conditions are not satisfied. Automatic triggers are those that are fired by the system when certain triggering conditions are satisfied.
