# Data Flow

Data Flow and Sequence Flow (collectively referred to as “Flow”) relationships are a means to transfer information objects from one structural element to another. These information objects could take the form of data that are required by the downstream structural element for its processing.

Data Flow relationships are an elementary construct in the process architecture model, and provides a simple hierarchical association between process structural elements.

They provide some indication of the sequential execution of process stages in the overall process architecture and help with readability of the model.

They connect “higher” order process stages to “lower” order process stages while transcending process boundaries.
