# Plan-Execute Relationship

A plan is the output of the planning process stage and can be an instruction set, an arrangement of actions, or a set of specifications that describes the method, means and constraints of executing the plan.

As a plan is informational in nature, thus data flow relationships can be considered as a Plan-Execute relationship if a plan is being transferred between two stages and that plan is directly executed by the immediate downstream process stage.

The planning process stage devises the plan irrespective of how the execution process stage will execute it. The execution process stage is aware of the plan internals so as to interpret and best execute the plan based on requirements and trade-off analysis that can be done as part of its execution.
