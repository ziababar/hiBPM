# Design-Use Relationship

The designs are black-boxes as user does not care (and is not informed) about the (internal) structure of a design artifact or how its built, and is only concerned about whether the functional and non-function objectives are achieved, when invoked during usage.

Such an act (of creating this tool or capability) can be considered as having two distinct process stages, one being responsible for creating the designed artifact, with the other being responsible for (repeatedly) consuming the designed artifact.

Thus, a Design-Use relationship exists between these process stages, with the process stage creating the artifact called the design stage and the one consuming the artifact called the use stage. A Design-Use relationship only exists if the design is used in a downstream, immediate PS.
