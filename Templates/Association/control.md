# Control Flow


The change is either through a “control” flow constraining the possible options for the target process at runtime or through an “execute” flow that changes the space of options for its target process by creating new capabilities. Hence, there is a hierarchy among processes that reflects their relative control order. The execution frequencies of both these levels typically differ as well.

Control is represented as a message flow adorned with “C” to mark a message flow that serves as a control input to a process stage.
