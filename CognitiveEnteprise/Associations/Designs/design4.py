# Quality Evaluator. This component is responsible for analyzing the influences of algorithms on (hierarchies of) softgoals. It recommends a list of algorithms to be included in or excluded from the workflow based on their influences on non-functional requirements. It depends on the Pattern Repository component to retrieve the list of relevant softgoals and also to retrieve the knowledge on how each algorithm is known to perform with respect to those softgoals. It also receives the importance and priority of softgoals from the Modeler.
