# Context Analyzer. This component is responsible for providing the status of context elements. It depends on the Pattern Repository to provide relevant context elements to be investigated. Given a pattern, this component parses the structure and generates a context analysis workflow (depending on structure of the graph). This allows for systematic discovery of alternatives for applying ML algorithms to the problem at hand, depending on which contexts hold.
