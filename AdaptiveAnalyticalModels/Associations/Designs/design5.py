# Workflow Planner. This component is responsible for suggesting analysis scenarios to be performed on the dataset. It interprets the verified contexts along with candidate algorithms and specifies the order of actions to be executed by the Data Preparator and Data Miner components. It also ensures that the necessary data preparation and model configurations (e.g., parameter values) are collected and transmitted for the execution.
